## Description
The purpose of this project is to be an educational and application instance of user experience design learning.

The problem to be solve by our group is to design a web aplication for kids under 18 so they can learn about astronomy in a fun and interactive way. Since this project is focused mainly in user experience design, this project will only describe the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface. All of this will be focused on a computer based aplication.

## Strategy
Our first step as a team, was to create the strategy. A "Value Proposition Canvas" is used to compare application and the posible solutions that it may bring to our users.

![Propuesta Valor (Strategy)](https://github.com/jabinherrera/UX/assets/89926906/0a8e86c7-d44e-43a0-95ea-63dd2e740993)

This process helped us understand our market segment and relate it to a value-adding proposition. From the previous figure, is worth mentioning the element in "Work to be done", "Show space images" and its counterpart in "Functionality", "Friendly elements and/or images", this allowed us to get a better understanding of our project. <!-- Decir si agregamos, mantubimos o descartamos ideas de las propuestas de valor al final del proyecto -->

## Scope
In this section we create a profile of our ideal customer and visualize how our product will work for them. So we created what is called a User Persona.

According to the UX Persona we define the customer journey map as a projection of what our user is going to feel when using our website.

We defined how to meet the strategic objectives in the previous section. These are converted into requirements through the benchmark canvas.

And we also made a comparative table for benchmarking.
