## Description
The purpose of this project is to be an educational and application instance of user experience design learning.

The problem to be solve by our group is to design a web aplication for kids under 18 so they can learn about astronomy in a fun and interactive way. Since this project is focused mainly in user experience design, this project will only describe the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface. All of this will be focused on a computer based aplication.
